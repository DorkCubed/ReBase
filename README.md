# Merge! roadmap 2024 - 2025

## Events:

- Workshop - Campus LIP (after first CSF111 lab each sem)
- Workshop - Non coding FOSS
- Apogee Hackathon
- Talk - GSOC and beyond (contact embryo / SARC)
- Language Shootout

## Internal Events:

- Clone and dissect - Sessions where we clone our favorite FOSS projects and try to understand the codebase.
- Foss Hack - Internal hackathons using something FOSS to make something FOSS
- Documentation doctor - Team up with [Canonical ODC](https://canonical.com/documentation/open-documentation-academy) to fix some docs.

## Recruitments:

- Technical Difficulties - Where we show how easy it is to fix your life with foss, geek out about linux, git, and the foss community.
- Orientation - Where we introduce people to the club, tell them what we do and start the recruitment process.
- Technical Round - Where we make several repositries (backend, frontend, app dev, etc.) with something wrong, a issue explaining the bug, and ask for a pull request with a fix.
- GD / PI (to decide) - For judging the passion for FOSS.
